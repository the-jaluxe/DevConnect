<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

DevConnect served as a way for me to start learning everything about developing web applications. Before this project, I had simply created small personal sites using
static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Before the initial development of the application, I had to start getting proficient with new front-end frameworks like React and
combining them with back-end frameworks such as NodeJS. This took alot of time coming from a mere student who had only known the C++ language learned from his
undergraduate coursework. After getting comfortable with these technologies, I was able to start.

DevConnect serves as a small social media site that allows developers to make public posts, leave comments on other posts, and like/dislike posts. It also features
profile creation and allows users to integrate their GitHub portfolio in their profile.
